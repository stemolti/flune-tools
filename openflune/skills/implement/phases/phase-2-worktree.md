# Phase 2: Worktree Setup

Read this file only when Phase 2 starts.

## Gate Check

Phase 2 only runs when `hasPlanFile` was set to true during mode detection — that is, the skill was **invoked** with a `.plans/<filename>.md` argument. A plan file written by Phase 1 in the current session does NOT satisfy this gate: new-plan sessions end at Phase 1, and implementation resumes in a fresh session.

Verify:

1. The invocation used a `.plans/<filename>.md` path (plan file mode from mode detection).
2. The plan file exists and was read.

If either check fails, stop and tell the user to run `/openflune:implement .plans/<filename>` in a fresh session.

## Create Worktree

Verify at least one commit exists:

```bash
git rev-parse HEAD 2>/dev/null
```

If the repository has no commits, create an initial commit:

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "chore: initial commit" --allow-empty
```

Create the worktree:

- Ticket mode: `git worktree add .worktrees/<ticket-id>-<description> -b feature/<ticket-id>-<description>`
- Ticketless mode: `git worktree add .worktrees/<auto-slug> -b feature/<auto-slug>`

All subsequent phases run inside the worktree. Use absolute paths rooted at `<worktree-path>` when delegating file edits.
