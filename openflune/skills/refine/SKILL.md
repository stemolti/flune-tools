## Context

**Config check**: Before anything else, verify `.claude/config.json` exists by reading it. If the file does not exist, **stop immediately** and tell the user:
"openflune is not configured for this project. Run `/openflune:configure` first to set up."

Read `.claude/config.json`.

**Parse `$ARGUMENTS`:**
The first token is the ticket ID. Everything after it is optional **user context** (additional instructions or focus areas).

Split `$ARGUMENTS` into:
- **Ticket ID**: the first whitespace-delimited token, with any leading `#` prefix stripped.
  For example: `#1 focus on API` → ID `1`, `7` → ID `7`.
- **User context**: everything after the first token (may be empty).
  For example: `42 focus on the API layer` → context is `focus on the API layer`.

**Shell rules**: Read the `shell-rules` skill before running any `gh` commands (covers heredoc temp-file pattern).

**Fetch the ticket:**
Extract owner/repo from `git remote get-url origin` (e.g. `git@github.com:owner/repo.git` → `owner/repo`), then run:
```bash
gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json number,title,body,labels,state,assignees,milestone,comments
```

## Attachments

Read the `attachments` reference skill and follow its 4-step procedure to discover, present, download, and load ticket attachments. If no attachments are found or the user selects none, proceed to Pre-flight Checks.

Store each image summary alongside its file reference for use during refinement.

## Pre-flight Checks

After fetching the ticket, inspect its current state before proceeding:

Check the issue's `labels` array and `state` field.

If any of these conditions are true, warn the user and ask for confirmation using `AskUserQuestion`:

| Condition | Message |
|-----------|---------|
| Ticket is closed/resolved | "This ticket is closed/resolved. Do you still want to refine it?" |
| Has "Refined" label/tag | "This ticket is already marked as Refined. Do you want to re-refine it?" |
| Has "Working" label/tag | "This ticket is currently being worked on. Do you want to re-refine it?" |
| Has "Implemented" label/tag | "This ticket is already marked as Implemented. Do you want to re-refine it?" |

If the user says no → stop. If yes → proceed normally.

## Label "Working"

**Before starting refinement work**, add the "Working" label to signal that the ticket is actively being worked on:
```bash
gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "Working"
```

## Your Role

You are a senior tech lead doing backlog refinement. Your goal is to ensure this
ticket is unambiguous, well-scoped, and ready for implementation.

## Process

1. **Fetch and summarize** the ticket (title, description, acceptance criteria, linked items)

2. **Read relevant `docs/<topic>.md`** files for the feature area. If a legacy `.claude/rules/lessons-learned.md` exists, read it as fallback.

3. **If user context was provided**, treat it as additional steering input. Focus your analysis and questions on the areas the user highlighted. Mention the user's context when it's relevant to your questions or analysis.

4. **Classify ticket type**: Determine if this ticket involves frontend/UI work — check whether the title, description, or acceptance criteria mention UI components, pages, views, layouts, forms, modals, visual design, styling, CSS, animations, themes, or frontend frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc.). If yes, activate **design-aware refinement** for this session. If purely backend/infrastructure/data, skip design-specific analysis.

   **Design Coverage Check** (if frontend ticket AND `pencil.enabled` is `true` in `.claude/config.json`):

   a. Read `pencil.designPath` from `.claude/config.json`.
   b. Use Glob to check if `.pen` files exist at the configured `designPath` (e.g., `<designPath>/**/*.pen`).
   c. Check if `<designPath>/DESIGN.md` exists. If it does, read it and evaluate coverage:
      - Are screens mapped? (Does the Screens table reference the screens relevant to this ticket?)
      - Are behavior annotations present? (Do mapped screens have interaction/state descriptions?)
      - Are component-to-code mappings documented? (Does the Components table link design components to framework components?)
   d. Report any gaps as informational findings — these are **not blocking**:
      - "Design coverage: N screens mapped, M components mapped, behavior annotations present/missing for [screen names]."
   e. If coverage is insufficient (no `.pen` files found, no DESIGN.md, or significant gaps in mappings), suggest:
      "Consider running `/openflune:design <ticket-id>` to generate a design spec before implementation."

5. **Analyze** what's missing or ambiguous. Consider:
   - Are acceptance criteria specific and testable?
   - Are edge cases covered?
   - Is the scope clear? Could it hide complexity?
   - Are API contracts defined (request/response shapes)?
   - Are there dependencies on other tickets?
   - Is the UI behavior specified (states, loading, errors)?
   - **If frontend ticket** — also evaluate design quality:
     - Is a visual direction or aesthetic tone specified, or will it default to generic?
     - Are typography, color palette, and spatial layout defined with intention?
     - Are motion/animation behaviors described, or will the result be static?
     - Does the ticket risk producing cookie-cutter design (generic fonts, predictable layout, cliched color schemes)?
   - **If frontend ticket AND `pencil.enabled` is `true`** — also evaluate design spec coverage:
     - Are the screens referenced in this ticket present in DESIGN.md?
     - Are behavior annotations present for the affected screens?
     - Are component-to-code mappings documented for all UI components in scope?
     - Are design tokens (spacing, color, typography) referenced for the affected components?
   - Are there security considerations?
   - Is it estimable? If not, what's blocking estimation?
   - If the ticket references existing apps ("like X", "similar to Y"), are the key UX patterns of those references captured? (e.g., layout model, navigation, interaction patterns)
   - Is it small enough for a single PR (~500 lines)? If not, should it be split into separate tickets?

6. **Ask ONE question at a time using `AskUserQuestion`**. Wait for the user's answer before asking the next. Never ask questions as plain text — always use the `AskUserQuestion` tool.
   - Be specific: "What should happen if the user submits an empty form?" not "Are errors handled?"
   - Reference existing code/patterns when relevant: "I see we use toast notifications elsewhere — should errors here also use toasts?"
   - **For frontend tickets — propose design directions instead of asking open-ended questions.** Don't ask "What typography should we use?" — instead propose: "For a [context], I'd suggest [specific font pairing] to avoid the generic Inter/Roboto look. Does this work, or do you have a different direction?" Apply this propose-first pattern to color palette, layout composition, and motion design.
   - Challenge vague design language: "clean and modern" or "professional look" almost always produces generic results. Push for what makes this interface *memorable*.
   - Limit design-specific questions to 2-3 per session. Focus on highest-impact decisions: aesthetic tone, one typography/color choice, and one layout/motion choice.

7. **After each answer**, update your understanding and decide:
   - Ask another question, OR
   - Declare the ticket refined

8. **Before producing the summary**, ask one final infrastructure question using `AskUserQuestion`:
   "Does this story need interactive browser access during implementation? (e.g., for visual verification, form testing, or web scraping). If yes, the implementer should ensure `playwright-cli` is installed (`npm i -g @playwright/cli`)."
   - If **yes** → note `browserRequired: true` for the labeling step
   - If **no** → proceed normally

9. **When refined**, produce:

   ## Refined Ticket Summary

   ### Updated Description
   <rewritten description incorporating all clarifications>

   ### Acceptance Criteria
   - [ ] <specific, testable criterion>
   ...

   ### Technical Notes
   - Affected services: <list>
   - Affected components: <list>
   - API changes: <list endpoints, methods, DTOs>
   - Database changes: <migrations needed>
   - Dependencies: <other tickets that must complete first>

   ### Design Coverage (if frontend ticket AND pencil.enabled)
   - **Screens mapped**: <list of screen names from DESIGN.md that relate to this ticket>
   - **Missing annotations**: <any screens lacking behavior annotations>
   - **Unmapped components**: <UI components without code mappings in DESIGN.md>
   - **Design tokens**: <coverage status — defined/missing for affected components>

   ### Design Direction (if frontend ticket)
   - **Aesthetic tone**: <chosen direction, e.g., "editorial with high-contrast typography">
   - **Typography**: <font pairing with rationale>
   - **Color palette**: <dominant + accent, hex values>
   - **Key motion**: <entrance animations, hover states, transitions>
   - **Layout approach**: <spatial strategy, any grid-breaking elements>
   - **Anti-patterns to avoid**: <generic choices explicitly ruled out>

   ### Size Estimate
   <S/M/L> — <reasoning>

   ### Suggested Split (if M or L)
   - Ticket 1 (1/N): <description>
   - Ticket 2 (2/N): <description> — depends on Ticket 1
   - Ticket 3 (3/N): <description> — parallel with Ticket 2
   (Each becomes its own numbered ticket and PR. The parent ticket tracks all children and their dependencies.)

   #### Execution Order
   - Ticket 1 → first (no dependencies)
   - Ticket 2, Ticket 3 → can start after Ticket 1 (parallel with each other)

   When analyzing the split, determine which child tickets have data/API/schema dependencies on others (sequential) vs. which touch independent areas (parallel). Annotate each ticket accordingly.

## Update Ticket

> **CRITICAL**: This section is mandatory after refinement. Do NOT skip it.
> All questions in this section MUST use the `AskUserQuestion` tool — never ask as plain text.

10. **Using `AskUserQuestion`**, ask: "Do you want me to update the ticket in GitHub with this refined information?"

   - If the user says **no** → skip to the label step below (step 12)
   - If the user says **yes** → proceed to step 11

11. **Update the ticket description in the remote system.**

   > **IMPORTANT**: Writing a temp file is NOT updating the ticket. You MUST execute the update command after writing the file. Never stop between writing the temp file and running the update command.

   ```bash
   printf '%s' '<updated description>' > /tmp/claude/issue-<number>.md
   BODY=$(cat /tmp/claude/issue-<number>.md)
   gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "$BODY"
   ```

   **Verify the update succeeded** — re-fetch the ticket and confirm the body was changed:
   ```bash
   gh issue view <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --json body --jq '.body' | head -c 200
   ```

   If the update failed, report the error to the user and retry once.

   If splitting, create the child tickets using a **two-pass approach**:

   Split tickets must also receive the "Refined" label/tag since they were refined during this session — `/implement` checks for it as a pre-flight condition.

   #### Pass 1: Create children with numbered titles and dependency info

   Create children **in dependency order** — independent children first, then children that depend on them (so you have their issue numbers for `Depends on` references).

   Each child title gets a `(K/N)` suffix, e.g. "Add API validation (1/3)".

   Each child body includes:
   - `Related to #<parent>` (links back to parent)
   - `Depends on #<sibling>` lines for any children it depends on (if applicable)
   - `Parallel with #<sibling>` lines for children it can run alongside (if applicable)

   Capture each created issue number from the command output.

   ```bash
   printf '%s' 'Related to #<original-number>
   Depends on #<sibling-number>
   Parallel with #<sibling-number>

   <ticket-body>' > /tmp/claude/issue-child-K.md
   BODY=$(cat /tmp/claude/issue-child-K.md)
   gh issue create --repo <owner>/<repo> --title "<ticket-title> (K/N)" --body "$BODY" --label "Refined"
   ```
   Parse the issue number from the URL in the output (e.g. `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/10` → `10`).

   Omit `Depends on` / `Parallel with` lines that don't apply (e.g. the first child typically has no dependencies).

   #### Pass 2: Update parent with tracking section

   After all children are created, re-read the parent ticket's current body and append a `### Child Tickets` section:

   ```markdown
   ### Child Tickets
   - [ ] #10 (1/3): Add API validation
   - [ ] #11 (2/3): Add frontend form — depends on #10
   - [ ] #12 (3/3): Add integration tests — parallel with #11

   **Execution order:** #10 first → then #11 and #12 in parallel
   ```

   Update the parent:
   ```bash
   printf '%s' '<existing-body>

   ### Child Tickets
   <checklist>' > /tmp/claude/issue-<original-number>.md
   BODY=$(cat /tmp/claude/issue-<original-number>.md)
   gh issue edit <original-number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --body "$BODY"
   ```

12. **Add the "Refined" label and remove "Working":**
   - If `browserRequired` is true:
     `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "Refined" --add-label "Browser" --remove-label "Working"`
   - Otherwise:
     `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "Refined" --remove-label "Working"`
   - If re-refining and `browserRequired` is false but the issue currently has the `Browser` label, also add `--remove-label "Browser"`
   - If the user declined the ticket update in step 10, use `AskUserQuestion` to ask: "Do you want me to mark this ticket as Refined?" and apply just the label if yes.

13. **Auto-label `ui:visual-check` for visual/layout tickets:**
   If the ticket description, acceptance criteria, or answers during refinement mention visual/layout signals — CSS, layout, responsive, theme, design tokens, styling, visual polish, animations, or appearance changes — add the `ui:visual-check` label:
   `gh issue edit <number> --repo <owner>/<repo> --add-label "ui:visual-check"`

   This label signals to the implement skill that interactive browser verification via Playwright CLI should be used.

## After Refinement

**STOP HERE.** Your job is done. Do not:
- Enter plan mode or propose an implementation plan
- Offer to run `/implement` or start implementation
- Suggest next steps beyond what's described above

The user will explicitly invoke `/implement` when they're ready to proceed.
