# Project: openflune

Claude Code plugin — Markdown skills, JSON config, shell hooks.
GitHub Issues for tracking. GitHub for code and PRs.

## Critical Rules
- ALWAYS read relevant `docs/` files when working in their topic area (e.g., `docs/git-workflow.md` before commits/PRs).
- Test-first: integration tests that assert behavior, not implementation details.
- No secrets, credentials, or API keys in code.
- No PII or stack traces in user-facing error responses.
- Keep tickets well-scoped. 1 ticket = 1 PR.
- Use git worktrees for all feature work. Never modify code in main worktree.

## Reference Docs
On-demand topic docs live at `docs/`:
- `docs/git-workflow.md` — branching, commits, PRs, versioning
- `docs/mobbin.md` — Mobbin design-reference MCP: setup, auth, rate limits, prompting (read before working on `--mobbin` design flows)

`.claude/rules/` is reserved for files explicitly `@`-imported by this CLAUDE.md (auto-loaded at session start). It is not used today.
