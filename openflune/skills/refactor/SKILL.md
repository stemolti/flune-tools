Read the `subagent-safety` reference skill before delegating work to subagents.

## Phase 1: Context Loading

Read `.claude/config.json`.
Read the `claudeMdLocation` field from `.claude/config.json` to determine where `CLAUDE.md` is located (defaults to `.claude/CLAUDE.md` if not set).

> **Progressive disclosure**: Do NOT eagerly read reference docs in this Context section. Read relevant `docs/<topic>.md` files (and any legacy `.claude/rules/lessons-learned.md` if present) when you reach the analysis step that needs them.

### Monorepo Context Loading

If `isMonorepo` is `true` in `.claude/config.json`:

1. **Determine affected project(s)**: From the scope and file paths, match against the `projects` array in config to identify which project(s) the analysis affects.
2. **Read per-project CLAUDE.md**: For each affected project, read `<project-path>/CLAUDE.md` for project-specific stack details and conventions.
3. **Pass project context to subagents**: When delegating to analyzers, include the per-project CLAUDE.md content. Tell the subagent to read any relevant `docs/<topic>.md` and any legacy `.claude/rules/lessons-learned-<slug>.md` (if it still exists) on demand.

**Shell rules**: Read the `shell-rules` skill before running any `gh` commands (covers heredoc temp-file pattern).

### Config Existence

Before any other checks, verify `.claude/config.json` exists by reading it. If the file does not exist, **stop immediately** and tell the user:
"openflune is not configured for this project. Run `/openflune:configure` first to set up."

### Parse Scope from `$ARGUMENTS`

- **If arguments provided** → use as explicit scope (file paths, directories, globs)
- **If no arguments** → determine scope from recent changes:
  ```bash
  git diff --name-only HEAD~10..HEAD
  ```
  If this returns files, use them as the scope.
- **If no git changes** → ask the user for scope via `AskUserQuestion`:
  > "No scope provided and no recent git changes found. Which files or directories should I analyze?"

## Phase 2: Scope Analysis

<details>
<summary>Phase details</summary>

1. **Gather target file list** from the determined scope:
   - If scope is a glob pattern → expand with Glob tool
   - If scope is a directory → list all source files recursively (exclude `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, `bin`, `obj`, lock files, and auto-generated files)
   - If scope is specific files → use directly
2. **Collect file metadata** for each file:
   - Full path
   - Line count (use `wc -l` via Bash)
   - Language (infer from extension)
   - Whether it's a test file (matches common patterns: `*.test.*`, `*.spec.*`, `*_test.*`, `*_spec.*`, files in `__tests__/`, `tests/`, `test/` directories)
3. **Read project stack info** from `.claude/config.json` — framework, testing library, language
4. **Prepare shared context string** for subagents containing:
   - File list with line counts and languages
   - Stack info (framework, testing, language)
   - Project conventions from CLAUDE.md
   - Lessons learned

</details>

## Phase 3: Parallel Analysis

Launch all 3 analyzers as parallel Task tool calls in a **SINGLE message**.

<details>
<summary>Phase details</summary>

1. **Gather shared context ONCE** before launching analyzers:
   - The file list with metadata from Phase 2
   - Full file contents for all in-scope files (read them before launching subagents — subagents should not need to re-read)
   - Stack info and CLAUDE.md conventions

2. **Launch ALL THREE analyzers as three parallel Task tool calls in a SINGLE message:**
   - Task 1: **duplication-analyzer** agent — pass file list + full file contents for scope
   - Task 2: **security-analyzer** agent — pass file list + stack info + CLAUDE.md conventions
   - Task 3: **structure-analyzer** agent — pass file list + line counts + test file identification

3. **Wait for all 3 to complete**, then proceed to Phase 4.

**Note on file contents**: For large scopes (20+ files), prioritize reading files that are most likely to have findings:
- Files over 200 lines
- Files modified recently (from git log)
- Test files over 300 lines
- Files with common vulnerability patterns (controllers, routes, auth, API handlers)

Pass full contents to the duplication analyzer (it needs to compare code blocks). For security and structure analyzers, pass file paths and key sections — they can read files themselves if needed.

</details>

## Phase 4: Results Consolidation

<details>
<summary>Phase details</summary>

Parse each agent's structured output and merge findings into a unified list.

### Deduplication

If multiple analyzers flag the same file/location:
- **Security + Duplication** both flag same code → keep as separate findings but note the overlap
- **Structure + Duplication** both flag same large file → merge into a single "Split and deduplicate" finding
- **Identical findings** from different analyzers → keep the one with more detail, discard the other

### Sorting and Grouping

1. **Sort by severity**: Critical → High → Medium → Low
2. **Group by category**: Security → Duplication → Structure
3. **Assign effort estimates** to each finding:
   - **S** (< 1hr): Simple extractions, constant consolidation, renaming
   - **M** (half day): File splits, shared module creation, test reorganization
   - **L** (1+ day): Architectural changes, security overhauls, major refactors

### Numbering

Assign each finding a sequential number (F1, F2, F3...) for easy reference in Phase 5.

Estimated total effort: <sum of effort estimates>
```

### No Findings

If all 3 analyzers returned no findings:
> "No refactoring issues found in the analyzed scope. The code looks clean!"

**STOP HERE** if no findings.

### User Decision

After presenting the report, ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Which findings should I create tickets for?"

Options:
- **All findings** — Create tickets for everything
- **Critical and High only** — Skip Medium and Low
- **Let me pick individually** — I'll ask about each one
- **None (keep report only)** — Don't create any tickets

If the user selects "None" → skip to Phase 7 (Summary) with no tickets created.

</details>

## Phase 6: Ticket Creation

**Main-agent-only** — requires auth for `gh` commands.

<details>
<summary>Phase details</summary>

### Prerequisites

Read the `shell-rules` skill before running any `gh` commands.

Extract `owner/repo` from `git remote get-url origin`.

### Individual Selection Mode

If the user selected "Let me pick individually":
- For each finding, present it briefly and ask via `AskUserQuestion`:
  > "Create a ticket for F<N>: <title>? (<severity>, <effort>)"
  Options: **Yes** / **No**
- Collect all approved findings, then create tickets for those.

### Ticket Body Template

For each approved finding, write the body to a temp file first (never use heredocs):

```bash
printf '%s' '## Refactoring: <title>

### Category
<Security | Duplication | Structure>

### Severity
<Critical | High | Medium | Low>

### Description
<finding description>

### Affected Files
- `path/to/file1`
- `path/to/file2`

### Suggested Approach
<how to fix, with code examples if relevant>

### Effort Estimate
<S | M | L> — <reasoning>

---
*Generated by openflune refactor analysis*' > /tmp/claude/refactor-ticket-F<N>.md
BODY=$(cat /tmp/claude/refactor-ticket-F<N>.md)
gh issue create --repo <owner>/<repo> --title "refactor: <title>" --body "$BODY" --label "Refined"
```

### Error Recovery

- If `gh` command fails with auth error → stop and tell the user to check authentication
- If ticket creation fails for one finding → report the error, continue with remaining findings
- If all ticket creations fail → report the error pattern and suggest manual creation
